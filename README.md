# Active Directory GPO & PowerShell Automation 🛡️💻

This project focuses on automating **user account management** and experimenting with **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** in **Active Directory** using **PowerShell**. The goal was to streamline administrative tasks, enforce policies, and improve the overall organization within the Active Directory environment.

## 📋 Project Summary

In this project, I worked on the following key areas:

- **Automated User Account Management**: Developed PowerShell scripts to **automate the creation** and **disabling** of user accounts, placing them in the appropriate **Organizational Units (OUs)**.
- **GPO Implementation**: Applied **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to enforce important policies, such as restricting **network drive access** and removing the **Recycle Bin** from users' desktops.
- **Account Organization**: Automatically moved **disabled accounts** to a "Disabled Accounts" **OU** for better organization and tracking of inactive users.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **🔄 Automated User Management**: PowerShell scripts to simplify the process of creating and disabling user accounts, reducing manual effort.
- **🔧 GPO Implementation**: Applied **GPOs** to restrict access to network drives and prevent file deletion by removing the **Recycle Bin** from desktops.
- **📂 Organized Accounts**: Disabled accounts are automatically moved to a dedicated **OU**, helping maintain a clean and well-organized Active Directory.
